Feel free to get involved with this project if you have any ideas or free time to burn fixing bugs.
Take a look at the issues page on github. There's probably nothing there cos I'm useless but you can look.

Everything is in Dart and we more or less follow Dart conventions with some exceptions:
- 120 length lines instead of 80
- Stricter about type annotation (pls no `var` or `dynamic` if you can avoid it)

But yeah apart from that just go wild. Make a fork, submit a PR.
