#### A multiplayer word guessing game.

This game is inspired by Wordle. I was playing it for a while with a group of good pals,
and thought it'd be cool to have a multiplayer version, so I built it. It was actually
pretty fun so I put a bit of time into it, and here we are.

It's free, libre, open source, etc, under the GPL license. TLDR: you can do whatever you
want with this code, as long as you provide the source code of your application to any
users you might have that use code derived from it. See the license for more details.
